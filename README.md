# book_management_system
Book Management System is an easy-to-use tool built to help you organize and manage books in libraries, bookstores, or personal collections. It makes it simple to add new books, update existing ones, delete books you no longer need, and search for specific titles. You can also manage important book details like the title, author, genre, ISBN. 

# Phases for Book Management System (BMS):

1. Requirements Phase:
This phase involves gathering and documenting all the necessary requirements from the stakeholders (such as users, business managers, and technical teams). The key deliverables are:

a) Functional Requirements:
	User login and authentication.
	Add, edit, delete, and search for books.
	Track book availability (borrowed/available).
	User profiles (admin and regular users).
	Book categories (fiction, non-fiction, etc.).
	Book transactions (borrow, return, reserve).
b) Non-Functional Requirements:
	Scalability and performance.
	Data security and privacy.
	User-friendly interface.
	Technical Requirements:

Web-based system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend.
Server-side with Node.js (Express).
Database: MySQL or MongoDB for storing book data.

2. Design Phase:
a) Database Design:
	Create ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for tables like Books, Users, Transactions.
b) UI/UX Design:
	Design wireframes for key pages (e.g., login, book list, book details, user profile).
c) Architecture Design:
        Design the system architecture (client-server and 3-tier model).

3. Implementation Phase:
a) Frontend Development:
	Develop static pages using HTML and CSS.
	Add interactivity using JavaScript (e.g., book search, form validation).
b) Backend Development:
	Set up a backend server using a suitable framework (e.g., Node.js with Express or Spring Boot).
	Set up the database and integrate with backend.
c) API Development:
	Develop RESTful APIs for book management (CRUD operations).

4. Testing Phase:
a) Unit Testing:
	Test individual components of the backend (API testing) and frontend (UI testing).
b) Integration Testing:
	Test the integration between the frontend, backend, and database.
c) User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
	Verify that the system meets the business requirements.

5. Deployment Phase:
	Deploy the application to a cloud server or web hosting service (e.g., AWS, Digital Ocean ,Heroku).
	Configure the database server and ensure all environment variables are set up correctly.
6. Maintenance Phase:
	Regular updates for bug fixes, security patches, and feature enhancements.
	Performance monitoring and scaling based on user growth.
